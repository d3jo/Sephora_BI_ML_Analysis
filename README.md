## ðŸ¤– Machine Learning

### ðŸ”¹ Hidden Gem Predictor Model

1. **Label Creation (`hidden_gem`)**
   - A product is labeled as **1 (hidden gem)** if:  
     - Rating â‰¥ 4.4 (good quality)  
     - Number of reviews < 50 (low visibility)  
   - Otherwise, itâ€™s **0 (not hidden gem)**.  
   â†’ This turns your dataset into a **binary classification problem**.

2. **Features Used**
   - **Numeric:** `price_usd`, `sale_price_usd`, `loves_count`  
   - **Categorical:** `brand_name`, `primary_category`

---

3. **Preprocessing Pipelines**
   - **Numeric pipeline:**  
     - Missing values â†’ filled with median (`SimpleImputer(strategy="median")`)  
     - Standardized (mean 0, variance 1) for stability  
   - **Categorical pipeline:**  
     - Missing values â†’ filled with most frequent  
     - Encoded as one-hot vectors (`OneHotEncoder`)  
   â†’ `ColumnTransformer` applies each pipeline to the correct set of columns.

4. **Model**
   - `XGBClassifier` (gradient boosting decision trees).  
   - XGBoost handles complex interactions well, especially with mix of numeric + categorical data.

---

5. **Train/Test Split**
   - 80% train, 20% test.  
   - `model.fit()` trains on training data (`X_train, y_train`).  
   - Predictions are compared with `y_test` to evaluate performance.
